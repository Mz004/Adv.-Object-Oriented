In this workshop 09, I've learned and understand various concepts like 
the utilization of binary files and processind data using multiple threads.
In my solution, I employed binary files to store and manipulate complex 
data structures, streamlining processes and ensuring data integrity.
Another important concept was the binding of functions to their arguments. 
This practice proved indispensable in this workshop, facilitating modularity 
and reusability. By binding functions to specific arguments, I was able to 
create specialized versions tailored to different scenarios.

The workshop also help me to understand significance of leveraging multiple 
threads. Harnessing the power of multi-threading to enhance performance and 
responsiveness in this workshop. By distributing tasks across threads, we 
effectively utilized system resources, optimizing overall efficiency. 
we implemented multi-threading, exemplifying the advantages of parallel execution.

Furthermore, we delved into futures and packaged_tasks, exploring their 
symbiotic relationship in concurrent programming. Futures allowed us to 
asynchronously retrieve results from parallel tasks, while packaged_tasks 
encapsulated computations for concurrent execution. By integrating these 
constructs with threads, we orchestrated seamless parallel workflows.
